Learning project to make a professional, personal website. I am not a web developer :)

### Tech Used
- HTML/CSS of course
- Amazon S3

This project exists to get my feet wet with making personal projects again & to start learning web development best practices with the eventual goal of hosting a dynamic website that showcases my portfolio.
